They had been used by his mother, Aunt Marge and Uncle Vernon as a wardrobe; his aunt's robes as an armchair.

Aunt Marge then returned to her robes, which were half-empty but still in their potted pink and purple-pink livery.

Harry could hear the rustling on inside Uncle Vernon's headboard, and at last saw the pearly gold bottle with the eagle feather on it.\n","\n","\"Oh,\" said Uncle Vernon, seizing the leather jacket from Harry's wrist and hurrying to pick it up. \"Can I borrow it?\"\n","\n","\"Er ... of course . . . I need that. . . .\" Harry said in pain. He knew it would be important to borrow a book. And yet he had never thought of that in the place where he had found Sirius's diary, and he could not borrow it very often. He also had never lent anything. He had no gold.\n","\n","\"This is, I hope, not difficult,\" said Uncle Vernon. \"It's not a big deal, it won't be difficult to keep your books, but I've got them now, don't worry, they're still in the family vault.\"\n","\n","Harry could hardly think of anything to do. He had to think whether his Uncle Vernon and his Aunt Marge's friends still wanted to give the library a go. The library now seemed destined for Harry's greatest ambition: The discovery of Sirius's diary on the seventh night of his expulsion from Hogwarts.\n","\n","With a great deal of regret he had spent five years in the library, and had, as time wore on, had little idea what he\n","\n","[410 | 974.17] loss=2.95 avg=2.88\n","[420 | 997.30] loss=2.54 avg=2.87\n","[430 | 1020.43] loss=2.65 avg=2.86\n","[440 | 1043.57] loss=2.66 avg=2.85\n","[450 | 1066.70] loss=2.87 avg=2.86\n","[460 | 1089.85] loss=2.86 avg=2.86\n","[470 | 1113.02] loss=2.67 avg=2.85\n","[480 | 1136.19] loss=2.70 avg=2.85\n","[490 | 1159.36] loss=2.82 avg=2.85\n","[500 | 1182.53] loss=2.62 avg=2.84\n","Saving checkpoint/run1/model-500\n","[510 | 1208.55] loss=2.61 avg=2.83\n","[520 | 1231.76] loss=2.74 avg=2.83\n","[530 | 1254.90] loss=2.58 avg=2.83\n","[540 | 1277.98] loss=2.66 avg=2.82\n","[550 | 1301.12] loss=2.58 avg=2.82\n","[560 | 1324.28] loss=2.67 avg=2.81\n","[570 | 1347.46] loss=2.62 avg=2.81\n","[580 | 1370.62] loss=2.70 avg=2.81\n","[590 | 1393.79] loss=2.63 avg=2.80\n","[600 | 1416.90] loss=2.58 avg=2.80\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n",".

And remember that the password will always be the same at the start of battle... That gives you an advantage over everyone else if you want to keep it secure.\n","\n","Don't forget that the passwords for the teams at the end of the match will always be the same, but if the password changes, the whole team will be sent down the wrong lane.\n","\n","\"But they might use the wrong password,\" said Mr. Crouch. \"They might use a password from the beginning of the match that says the team's first password, but it's going to be one of the best if the other teams play really bad and try and hold it.\"\n","\n","The team had one chance to respond, and the only one left was to use the quickest and darkest of the password to send them their first pass. They had the trick.\n","\n","\"And I have never done that before,\" Mr. Crouch went on. \"The second password came down the very first lane, was much lower than the second password and it led to the worst possible situation! I had a couple of very angry games, but I managed to come up with the second password for the match; that was my third and I didn't waste all our time trying. I did, however, try and keep it as the second and third, and just in the end... my guess is I managed, but unfortunately, they were only able to hold it off for a couple of minutes.\n","\n","\"So I hope Harry Potter's not going to do anything stupid, eh? Well, you have to do that carefully and have the right password, whatever it is, because this match's not going to be a very good one for it. We're going to play a really bad team by the middle and no one can put up with it for another hour. But it's not going to be an easy game for the Gryffindor side, they're going to have to compete.\"\n","\n","The Gryffindors played another great game, this time with fewer than twenty points to play, although Harry knew what he looked like going on about being the best Gryffindor in the school. They made the match even worse by beating Scrimgeour and Binns. After that game, they played a game the second and third passwords in Harry's mind.\n","\n","\"Oh, Harry! Harry! I know this one, which looks all like Snape! Well, he was good, I'll admit it: he seemed to have trouble trusting everyone else. Now, I'm not complaining... I really must've done something wrong... but the last time the game went badly wrong, I was so close to winning...\"\n","\n","\"Harry, Harry... I didn't!\" Hermione snarled, clutching his arm.\n","\n","\"No, really, I was in the lead with Quirrell!\" Harry called. \"I was just ahead again...\"\n","\n","\"And who's Quirrell, anyway?\" said Mr. Crouch irritably, rolling his eyes at them. \"You're going to get more points for winning tonight? How did you do?\"\n","\n","\"No one,\" Harry said. \"I thought you'd do better than that stupid game I played with the Slytherins.\"\n","\n","\"They had to come up to me and try and force me onto their team, and I was quite brave, but I just couldn't get the Slytherins to join --\"\n","\n","\"We fought,\" said Mr. Crouch quickly.\n","\n","\"Let's get going, then,\" said Ron, \"Let's go, get back in bed.

you can do `text = gpt2.generate(sess, return_as_list=True)[0]`\n","\n","You can also pass in a `prefix` to the generate function to force the text to start with a given character sequence and generate text from there (good if you add an indicator when the text starts).\n","\n","You can also generate multiple texts at a time by specifing `nsamples`. Unique to GPT-2, you can pass a `batch_size` to generate multiple samples in parallel, giving a massive speedup (in Colaboratory, set a maximum of 20 for `batch_size`).\n","\n","Other optional-but-helpful parameters for `gpt2.generate` and friends:\n","\n","*  **`length`**: Number of tokens to generate (default 1023, the maximum)\n","* **`temperature`**: The higher the temperature, the crazier the text (default 0.7, recommended to keep between 0.7 and 1.0)\n","* **`top_k`**: Limits the generated guesses to the top *k* guesses (default 0 which disables the behavior; if the generated output is super crazy, you may want to set `top_k=40`)\n","* **`top_p`**: Nucleus sampling: limits the generated guesses to a cumulative probability. (gets good results on a dataset with `top_p=0.9`)\n","* **`truncate`**: Truncates the input text until a given sequence, excluding that sequence (e.g. if `truncate='<|endoftext|>'`, the returned text will include everything before the first `<|endoftext|>`). It may be useful to combine this with a smaller `length` if the input texts are short.\n","*  **`include_prefix`**: If using `truncate` and `include_prefix=False`, the specified `prefix` will not be included in the returned text."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8DKMc0fiej4N","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1567016864688,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":7829,"user":{"displayName":"Max Woolf","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AAuE7mD2mXear_qVUygpwsjIX8bFdN6WN2fKW_XEDgsFOA=s64","userId":"10954469476206133987"}},"outputId":"526dbd1b-f076-4f47-a42b-058ab4a35b9f"},"source":["gpt2.generate(sess,\n","              length=250,\n","              temperature=0.7,\n","              prefix=\"LORD\",\n","              nsamples=5,\n","              batch_size=5\n","              )"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["LORD WILLOUGHBY:\n","That, by the way, Clarence and I have done good side by side;\n","And yet side we, and he side we have done ill.\n","\n","KING RICHARD II:\n","Why then 'tis done ill.
