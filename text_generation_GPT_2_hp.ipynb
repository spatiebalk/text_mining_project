            "The door swung open, and Harry took in her every step, wondering what she had been saying.\n",
            "\"Harry, how come you didn’t go on?\" gasped Hermione.\n",
            "\"I was scared,\" said Harry. \"I was under the impression that there was something very important to tell you. Didn’t really seem to occur to you that you had to leave Hogwarts. I mean, how has Hogwarts changed over time?\"\n",
            "\"It’s not that bad,\" said Harry darkly. \"It’s quite the same, I think.\"\n",
            "\"That’s a good question,\" said Harry. \"It’s been in a bit of a state for a while, is it not?\"\n",
            "\"Well, I believe it has,\" said Hermione, who appeared to have seen Harry’s mind racing. \"It is, you’d bet it’s not the same when we meet again.\"\n",
            "\"Oh,\" said Harry quickly, when she smiled and said nothing more. \"Then I’d better come off, I think I -\"\n",
            "She’d be proud of her. He pulled out his wand from behind his robes and charged at her.\n",
            "\"Harry, if I had -\"\n",
            "But Harry had the sensation that she was going to burst into her frame and run, and in a flash, she had smashed everything he had ever seen off the wall.\n",
            "\"Hermione,\" said Harry urgently, and when she had stopped, she ran right over to the door and turned the door with her other hand. Harry was glad to see the door crackle and he pushed it open.\n",
            "There was a knocking and an eerie silence. Hermione’s voice was interrupted.\n",
            "\"You want to know what happened after you’d called?\" said Harry in a low voice, before the door creaked open.\n",
            "He looked around; there was Professor McGonagall in the doorway. \"She tried to intervene. We heard her shouting at the door. . . but nobody could hear who she was. Well, no harm, really; this isn't going to help. Now, I want to talk about my theory about magic.\"\n",
            "Professor McGonagall looked sternly at Harry as she spoke, but Harry knew better; as she was the Headmaster, he had sworn that he was going to get her things from her if he wanted to.\n",
            "Harry looked around. There was Professor McGonagall shaking hands with Harry, an expression of very deep satisfaction on her face. The rest of the class was all whispering in hushed tones.\n",
            "\"Professor McGonagall...\" Harry repeated very loudly.\n",
            "\"Er - yeah?\"\n",
            "Harry pulled out his wand again and tapped its handle. As he felt his head slide off the wall, he looked around as though hoping that it would burst, and the door did indeed break in two.\n",
            "\"Hermione! How’re you?\"\n",
            "\"Out of hand now,\" said Harry, trying to get up as quickly as possible.\n",
            "Ron came running up behind him.\n",
            "\"Professor, I need help, Harry,\" he said urgently. \"I’ve got to get Professor McGonagall’s wand -\"\n",
            "\"Er - what?\"\n",
            "It wasn’t that hard. If there was a spell that would help, it must be worked on.\"\n",
            "\"You want to help me work on it, Harry? I want her to get the spell correct.\"\n",
            "Harry put his wand back in his pocket and tapped her on the shoulder.\n",
            "\"I will. . . come on.\"\n",
            "Harry moved away again. Ron’s eyes were still fixed on the ceiling.\n",
            "For the first time that day they had not been alone for a long time. Hermione, the headmistress, opened her mouth in surprise.\n",
            "\"My apologies for the interruption of the first lesson!\" she said angrily. \"My wand was in such trouble; I should have seen it coming.. . well, I’m sorry.\"\n",
            "Hermione turned pale, but Ron laughed.\n",
            "\"Oh?\" she said, with a worried look at him, as she strode along with Professor McGonagall and went off into the dark.\n",
            "\"Professor - what’s up?\"\n",
            "\"We’ve been talking since I got back from the Burrow and I’ve only just found out that we were discussing the Elixir of Life again. It’s been bothering us for ages, but I really, really wanted to ask you a question.\"\n",
            "She closed her eyes and looked around, but she did not elaborate, as she looked suddenly, strangely, at a picture that had appeared on the wall behind Neville. Harry heard Professor McGonagall’s hand clench as she closed her eyes again, but he did not attempt to stop himself.\n",
            "\"Well,\" he grunted, \"one of those funny little things you\n",
